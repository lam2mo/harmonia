# Harmonia

This program manages collections of songs with guitar chords and helps with
scheduling song sets, transposing chords, and other things that I found helpful
during my time as a song leader at various churches.

DISCLAIMER: This project is not under active development; it is a utility I
wrote as an undergrad that I found while going through some old files and
decided to post on Github in case it's useful to someone. I no longer actively
use it.

## Getting Started

To build the distribution file, run `ant dist`. Then run the `harmonia`
command in the repository root to execute the program.
